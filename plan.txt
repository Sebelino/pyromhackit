= Extract the script of the game =

1. Find the location of the game's script, e.g. by using Geiger's debugger and studying what instructions are run when Karen speaks.

2. The script should consist of a sequence of identifiers for letters (unless the script is compressed). Take note of the identifier for each letter.

3. Write a Python program that reads the script portions of the ROM and outputs them to the terminal.

4. Modify the program so that it outputs the corresponding letters instead of the identifiers. If all goes well, you should now be able to spot a semi-garbled script.
